## Requirements

### Hardware

For a complete test installation (front + back + BDD), the following is a
minimum:

- 4 CPUs
- 8 GB RAM
- 100 GB Storage

Actual requirements will heavily depend on the number of users / API calls,
database size, and business lines.

### Software

- Docker: 20.10+ (<https://docs.docker.com/>)
- Docker compose: 1.29+ (<https://docs.docker.com/compose>)

### Permissions

Various components will need access to the filesystem for reading / writing.
The location on the host where this will happen can be configured (see
Configuration), the default value being `/coog`.

- For a development environment, the "simplest" way to manage permissions is to
allow everything:

```shell
sudo chmod -R 1777 /path/to/root
```

- In a "real" environment, the folders that we actually need to have access are
those that can be used when sharing files between the application and other
systems (or users). Those are the `coog_tmp` / `coog_data` folder (see
configuration for details on how to configure their path).
Since the application is run as user 1003, the access rights will usually be
set like so:

```shell
sudo chown 1003:1003 /path/to/coog_data
sudo chown 1003:1003 /path/to/coog_tmp
```

### Generate certificates for localhost

- Install mkcert

```shell
(cd /tmp && wget https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases/download/v1.4.1/mkcert-v1.4.1-linux-amd64)
sudo mv /tmp/mkcert-v1.4.1-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/mkcert
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mkcert
mkcert -install
```

- Create a certificat for "coog.localhost" (change the prefix based on the
project name). The docker-compose project expects "certs" in its root folder

```shell
mkdir certs && mkcert -cert-file certs/cert.pem -key-file certs/key.pem "coog.localhost"
```

## Configuration

This project's main configuration is generated from two files:

- `env.base`, which should not be modified, but is the actual template
- `env.custom`, which can be used to provide mandatory values (versions, etc),
as well as overriding some parts of the configuration. Documentation for what
must / can be modified can be found in `env.custom.sample`

When using any of the commands in the `bin` folder (or manually calling
`bin/configure`), the values from those files will be combined to generate a
`.env` file at the root of the repository.

**DO NOT MANUALLY MODIFY THIS FILE**, as it will be overwritten everytime a
command is called.

If you need to manually launch `docker-compose` commands after modifying the
`env.custom` file, make sure to call `bin/configure` first.

### Minimum configuration

This is a minimal `env.custom` file, containing the few environment variables
that **must** be available.

```shell
# The version to load. Will be the default for all components, but each can be
# set separately if required
IMAGE_VERSION_COOG=coog-2.13.2134

# Where the data will be stored
FILESYSTEM_ROOT=/coog

# Encryption key used for generating jwt token for API communication
JWT_ENCRYPTION=change_me

# Token used for communication between API services and the backoffice
COOG_GATEWAY_TOKEN=api_token_for_api_user

# Not necessary to modify (defaults to "coog"), but usually will be
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=demo
```

*Note for developers: when using multiple environments, `FILESYSTEM_ROOT` can
be set directly in a `.bashrc` or a `.envrc` file so it is not necessary to
re-define it in every environment*

### Disabling services

By default, starting the project will start all services defined in the
`compose` folder. Services that you do not need can be disabled by adding them
in a `disabled_services` file at the root of the project.

For instance, to disable the "front/app-b2c" service, run the following command
at the project's root:

```shell
echo "front/app-b2c" >> disabled_services
```

### Specific services configuration

There are specific environment files in the `env` folder to customize the
behaviour of specific services.

Documentation for what can be done and how is in the `defaults/env` folder.

## Commands

**docker-compose commands will usually work**, however when modifying
`env.custom` (or updating the project), you must call `bin/configure` first.
Using the provided commands below will take care of this for you.

### Refresh configuration

```shell
./bin/configure
```

### Starting up

```shell
./bin/up
```

or (run in background)

```shell
./bin/up -d
```

Note thate `bin/up` is juste a wrapper around `docker-compose up` that first
calls `bin/configure`. Any parameters passed to it will be forwarded to
`docker-compose`

### Shutting down

```shell
./bin/down
```

### Initialize the database

The following command will drop an existing database (if needed), then init a
new empty database. It will ask for the admin password:

```shell
./bin/manage_db reset
```

The name of the database will be the name of the main database of the project
(defaults to "coog").

An additional database can be managed by passing the `--database` parameter:

```shell
./bin/manage_db reset --database another_database
```

### Upgrade the database

The following command will update the database.

```shell
./bin/manage_db update
```

Additional parameters will be modules to install on the database:

```shell
./bin/manage_db update contract claim loan
```

As is the case for the `reset` command, this command can be run on another
database by using the `--database` parameter.

### Create a backup

The following command will create a backup of the database in `/tmp/backup_file`

```shell
./bin/manage_db dump /tmp/backup_file
```

Default format is a flat "sql" file, however this can be controlled using the
`--format` option, to use a binary format, or zip the sql output

```shell
./bin/manage_db dump --format bin /tmp/backup_file
```

If the backup file name is not provided, it will be generated with the database
name, the current date, and the format extension. It will then be moved to `/tmp`

As is the case for the `reset` command, this command can be run on another
database by using the `--database` parameter.

**Note: This command can be used while the application is running without
interrupting the services**

### Load from a backup

The following command will load the `/tmp/backup_file` backup in the database

```shell
./bin/manage_db load /tmp/backup_file
```

Default behavior assumes a flat "sql" file, however this will crash if the
input file is actually a binary file (or a zipped sql file). Same as above,
this can be controlled using the `--format` parameter

```shell
./bin/manage_db load --format sip /tmp/backup_file.zip
```

As is the case for the `reset` command, this command can be run on another
database by using the `--database` parameter.

### Modify admin password

The admin password for the database can be modifid using the following command:

```shell
./bin/manage_db change_admin_password
```

As is the case for the `reset` command, this command can be run on another
database by using the `--database` parameter.

### Anonymize a database

The following command can be used to anonymize the database. **This is not
reversible**.

The script can be customized by changing the values of the variables
declared in the anon_db function.

```shell
./bin/manage_db anonymize
```

As is the case for the `reset` command, this command can be run on another
database by using the `--database` parameter.

### Run daily chain

The daily chain can be run using the following command:

```shell
./bin/daily 5 french_work_days
```

There will usually be two arguments, to indicate how business days should be
considered. The previous example runs with "5" business days ahead, using the
"french_work_days" configuration.

This command can be set in the crontab of the host to run every day.

**Note: This command uses the mechanisms introduced in Coog 2.12 for daily chain
configuration in side the application**

## Creating custom services

The `./bin/configure` command, which is used to generate the configuration,
adds services by looking in the `compose` directory.

That makes adding custom services straightforward, just add a new `yml` file in
the appropriate sub-directory, re-run `./bin/configure`, and they should be
detected.

## FAQ

### Using services deployed on localhost

In some cases (development / debugging), it may be useful to run the API /
front part of the application with the compose project, using a locally running
Coog backoffice service.

To do so, you must:

- Ensure your local Coog server listen on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
- Use the special "host.docker.internal" hostname for your
CUSTOM_COOG_INTERNAL_URL
- Enable host integration for the project, by setting the
"ENABLE_HOST_NETWORK_INTEGRATION" variable to "1" in your `env.custom` file

*Note: This can be done for other services, however the typical use case will
be for backend developers, hence this particular example*

### [PORTAL][B2B] Error: Not allowed by CORS

By default, you should not be able to use the protocol https:// because it is not configured. You must therefore use the protocol http://.
