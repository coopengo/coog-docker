## 2021-09-16 Refactoring

### Rationale

Commit 3a6b810 from 16th of september 2021 fundamentally changed how the project
behaves.

Before, most of the environment variables required were mixed together in the
`var.env` file, with some informations copied across various variables (ex:
database connexion information).

Furthermore, the only way to actually configure the project (enabling /
disabling / modifying services) was to modify the repository, which made any
update complicated.

This refactoring solves both those issues by first reworking how environment
variables are configured, and second by offering the possibility to move all
configuration in a custom folder, separate from the git repository. For more
information, see the README at the top of this repository.

### Migrating

*Note: the details of what is discussed below can be found in the README*

#### Disabling services

Rather than modifying the `docker-compose.yml` file to comment out services that
are not needed, it is now possible to list the services to disable in the
`disabled_services` file.

#### Modifying / Adding services

If a `override.yml` file is found, it will be loaded after the various service
files. As per the docker-compose specification, this can be leveraged to modify
the configuration of those services.

Also, adding new services is as easy as adding a `my_service.yml` file in the
`custom/compose` folder.

#### Daily Batch run

The `bin` folder includes a few scripts that aims to simplify the use /
exploitation of the solution (database dumps / restoration, manual updates, etc.)

Among thos, the `bin/daily` script can be used to trigger the daily batch run.
The appropriate command line for use in a crontab can be found in the README.

#### Environemnt variables migration

The basic logic of the project is as follow:

- The `env.custom` file contains environment variables that are defining how the
various services will communicate with one another
- The files in the `env` folder (most notably `back.env` for the backoffice
configuration) can be used to configure the environment variables for each
service individually

**The `.env` file is automatically generated from the `env.custom` file and must
not be manually modified (modification will be overwritten on the next start of
the application)**

Variables to add:

|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name                  | Usage                                                                  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FILESYSTEM_ROOT       | Base mount points for the filesystem                                   |
| IMAGE_VERSION_DEFAULT | Standard image version, used to initialize the versions for all images |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|

To manage the images for the project, set `IMAGE_VERSION_DEFAULT` is enough to
set the version for all components. If needed, it is still possible to set the
version for a specific component with the `IMAGE_VERSION_<component>` variables.

Similarly, the name of the images are the defaults from Coopengo, but they can
be overriden with the `CUSTOM_IMAGE_NAME_<component>` variables.

Global environment variables mapping:

|-------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------|
| Previous Variable       | New Variable                   | Default Value |
|                         |                                | is consistent |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------|
| NETWORK_BACKEND_NAME    | CUSTOM_NETWORK_BACKEND_NAME    | Yes           |
| NETWORK_BACKEND_SUBNET  | CUSTOM_NETWORK_BACKEND_SUBNET  | Yes           |

| NETWORK_FRONTEND_SUBNET | CUSTOM_NETWORK_FRONTEND_SUBNET | Yes           |
| COOG_TMP                | CUSTOM_COOG_TMP_VOLUME         | Yes           |

Backoffice configuration mapping (`env/back.env`):

|---------------------------|--------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Previous Variable         | New Variable       | File          | Comment                                                                                |
|---------------------------|--------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TRYTOND_\*                | TRYTOND_\*         | `back.env`    | The connexion informations to other internal services are no longer necessary          |
| WHITELIST                 | CORS_WHITELIST     | `env.custom`  | Default value is consistent                                                            |
| COOG_API_\*               |                    |               | Those were only connexions to internal services and are no longer needed               |
| BASE_PATH                 |                    |               | Removed                                                                                |
| \*\_DB_\*                 | CUSTOM_POSTGRES_\* | `env.custom`  | In case of inconsistency (ADMIN_DB_\* / COOG_DB_\* / COOG_POSTGRES_\*), prefer COOG_\* |
| COOG_WEB_TOKEN            | COOG_GATEWAY_TOKEN | `env.custom`  |                                                                                        |
| JWT_(INTERNAL)_ENCRYPTION | JWT_ENCRYPTION     | `env.custom`  |                                                                                        |
| MONGO_\*                  | CUSTOM_MONGO_\*    | `env.custso`  | If the values are standard (host / port), no need to set them                          |
| LOG_LEVEL                 | COOG_LOG_LEVEL     | `env.custom`  |                                                                                        |
|---------------------------|--------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

*Note: For the other services, the only values in the `.env` files were to
configure how to interact with internal services. They are no longer necessary
as this kind of information is now configured once and for all in `env.custom`
and automatically propagated. Those `.env` files are usually empty now*

Other:

- It is possible to define how many processes we want for the backoffice /
celery processes with the `COOG_CELERY_WORKERS` and `COOG_SERVER_WORKERS` variables
- It is possible to force which batches can be run by the celery service using
the `COOG_CELERY_CUSTOM_QUEUES` variable
